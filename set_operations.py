# Program to illustrate different set operations in Python

# Define two sets
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Perform set operations
print("Union of E and N is", E | N)
print("Intersection of E and N is", E & N)
print("Difference of E and N is", E - N)
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is", E ^ N)
